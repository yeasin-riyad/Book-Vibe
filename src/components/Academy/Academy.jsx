            <h1 className='py-2 text-3xl'>(1)Amazon Book Review</h1>
            <p className='bg-base-200 py-7 px-3 rounded-xl'>This book blog topped Scribendi's 2020 list, and it's easy to see why. It's probably the most comprehensive book blog out there for contemporary works, and it covers all kinds of genres. The Editors' Picks seem to have something for everyone.</p><br />

            <p className='bg-base-200 py-7 px-3 rounded-xl'>All of this booky goodness is presented on a bright, easy-to-navigate website. There are even celebrity picks, where "celebrity" encompasses not only film and TV stars but also athletes, musicians, and authors. I must say that this book blog also tops my list when it comes to what's hot off the press and for its sheer variety.</p>

            <h1 className='py-2 text-3xl'>(2) John Pistelli</h1>
            <p className='bg-base-200 py-7 px-3 rounded-xl'>If you're not concerned about hot topics and current events and are just looking for a good read, then this is the site for you.

John Pistelli is a professor at the University of Minnesota and holds a Ph.D. in English literature. He has also published several works of fiction and poetry. His website provides a new book review every week or so, and his choices are anchored in his personal interests, which center on classic and contemporary fiction. Take a look at his review index for a ton of books to choose from, each with his thoughtful and artful opinions and musings. He covers novels, nonfiction, poetry, drama, and comics, and he even throws in some commercial fiction for good measure.

What also caught my eye is his "lifetime reading list," which includes titles you'd expect to be recommended by an English professorâ€”but also some surprises.</p>

        <h1 className='py-2 text-3xl'>(3) Literary Hub</h1>
        <p className='bg-base-200 py-7 px-3 rounded-xl'>This book blog has everything you need to keep up to date with the literary world, plus some news and culture on the side. In addition to its numerous resources for both reading and writing, what caught my attention is its "Book Marks" section.

Similar to what "Rotten Tomatoes" does for movies, "Book Marks" compiles book reviews from magazines, newspapers, and websites and averages them into a score of "Rave," "Positive," "Mixed," or "Pan." You can also leave your own comments and reviews. Literary Hub is also a great site for finding your next favorite book-related podcast.</p>
